Looks like we can get the thing from Amazon as well.

Hey Jake, 

Due to the pitot sensors being really lame I'm this close to just purchasing our own breakout board shown here
http://www.dx.com/p/breakout-board-mpxv7002dp-apm2-5-airspeed-sensor-274643#.V45NvnUrL8t

and then getting tubes from here
http://www.auav.co/product-p/pitot.htm

or here
https://www.hobbytown.com/eagle-tree-systems-prandtl-pitotstatic-tube-kit-etrpitot-kit-v3/p377400?gclid=Cj0KEQjwwry8BRDjsbjMpPSDvagBEiQA5oW0nDkvO3TxqExB1cNrg0lTEJgnS4bcBCWrkDNYScjKplwaAqKq8P8HAQ

Thing is apparently the circuit is super easy. So it might even be possible to purchase the device itself from here
http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/freescale-semiconductor-nxp/MPXV7002DPT1/MPXV7002DPT1CT-ND/3524215

and solder the circuit ourselves. I just checked the data sheet and I've attached two figures. I have a few questions. 

1.) In the first graphic it says that pins 5-8 are N/C (Not connected?) If that's the case why are they there? - Yes it means Not connected and it's probably there for show I guess.
2.) In the second graphic it says to connect the device to some capacitors to filter the output. I'm guessing all the capacitors are hooked to a common ground? I'm not sure what those triangles are. The bottom triangles are indeed ground.

We can just get tubes here
http://www.auav.co/product-p/pitot.htm

and a breakout board from here
http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shipping-1pc-CJMCU-36-APM2-5-airspeed-meter-Breakout-Board-MPXV7002DP/1324980199.html?spm=2114.40010308.4.27.q0OE1H

This one is kind of similar

Nemo found this breakout board which is super stout
http://www.dx.com/p/breakout-board-mpxv7002dp-apm2-5-airspeed-sensor-274643#.V45NvnUrL8t

The sensor is the MPXV7002DP. We can get just the board here
http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/freescale-semiconductor-nxp/MPXV7002DPT1/MPXV7002DPT1CT-ND/3524215

The data sheet is here
https://www.nxp.com/files/sensors/doc/data_sheet/MPXV7002.pdf

The data sheet says we need the following capacitors
470pF - http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/vishay-bc-components/S471K29Y5PP63K5R/1286PH-ND/2356822
0.01 uF - http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/vishay-bc-components/S103M47Z5UN63J7R/1255PH-ND/412808
1.0 uF - http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/nichicon/UMA1H010MCD2TP/493-10419-3-ND/4312418

This is exactly what we want but it's currently sold out

We ordered two from Hobby King but the quality control is awful

This airspeed sensor from FrSky is good but it uses S.port protocol
https://alofthobbies.com/frsky-airspeed-sensor-spass-70-167mph-rated.html

This is from ebay but it just seems sketchy
http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/281675937325?lpid=82&chn=ps&ul_noapp=true

Nemo says NO for ebay stuff. Plus they ship with FedEx, which sucks.

So tubing. We initially bought the following tubing from McMasterCarr
http://www.mcmaster.com/#catalog/122/136/=14cd9hb
SKU = 50315K67

The ID = 1.8mm and OD = 3 mm however the durometer was 95A. Super hard!

According to this website however 
https://www.hobbytown.com/prandtl-pitotstatic-tube-kit-by-eagle-tree-systems-etrpitot-kit-v3/p377400?gclid=Cj0KEQjwwry8BRDjsbjMpPSDvagBEiQA5oW0nDkvO3TxqExB1cNrg0lTEJgnS4bcBCWrkDNYScjKplwaAqKq8P8HAQ
The ID is smaller. 
Pitot Tube Hose: Silicon, clear, 3 feet (1 meter), 1.5mm ID, 2.5mm OD

Thing is I'm not sure I believe this because if you look at this pitot tube
https://www.hobbytown.com/prandtl-pitotstatic-tube-kit-by-eagle-tree-systems-etrpitot-kit-v3/p377400?gclid=Cj0KEQjwwry8BRDjsbjMpPSDvagBEiQA5oW0nDkvO3TxqExB1cNrg0lTEJgnS4bcBCWrkDNYScjKplwaAqKq8P8HAQ

versus this pitot tube
http://www.auav.co/product-p/pitot.htm

You can see that the pitot probe itself has a larger tube.  Anyway so  I think 1.8 mm is fine.

1.8 mm = 0.0708661 inches

Be careful though

1.5 mm = 0.0590551 inches

So you want it a bit bigger than 1/16" = 0.0625 inches

so 5/64 = 0.078125" thus I am going to buy

25 ft of 1/16" ID and 5/64" ID just in case 1/16" is too small I also purchased 65A durometer instead of 95A so this should be considerably more flexy. Yes. 

1.8 mm!!

Read the fine print - freaking lubricant
